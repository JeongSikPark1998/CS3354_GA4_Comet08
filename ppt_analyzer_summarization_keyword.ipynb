The presentation then proceeds to discuss the consequences of architectural design flaws, providing examples of such flaws. It talks about the architectural design process, objectives, and decisions, focusing on maintainability, use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) parts, system performance, security, safety, availability, reliability, fault tolerance, and recovery. The presentation explains four types of systems/subsystems, namely interactive systems, event-driven systems, transformational systems, and database systems, and provides examples for each. It also discusses different software architecture styles, such as client-server architecture, N-tier or multi-tier architecture, main program and subroutines architecture, event-driven system architecture, and persistence framework architecture.

It focuses on being flexible, responsive, and adaptive in the face of uncertainties, evolving customer needs, and market conditions. 2. Agile approach: a project management and product development methodology that emphasizes iterative and incremental progress, collaboration, and flexibility. In Agile, work is organized into small, manageable tasks called sprints, which are typically two to four weeks in duration. Teams prioritize and complete these tasks while regularly reassessing and adjusting their priorities based on feedback and changing requirements. 3. Bare-minimum architecture: the simplest possible structure or design for a system that can still meet its basic functional requirements. This approach is usually not recommended for complex systems, as it can lead to significant challenges when it comes to expanding or refining the architecture to accommodate new features or improvements. 4. Refactoring: the process of restructuring and improving existing code without changing its external behavior or functionality. This can involve cleaning up the code, optimizing performance, or simplifying the design to make it more maintainable and easier to understand. 5. Revamping: the process of making significant improvements or overhauling an existing system, product, or process. In the context of software architecture, this might involve rethinking the overall design, updating outdated components, or introducing new technologies to better align with current requirements and best practices. 6. Scratch: In the context of software development, \\\"starting from scratch\\\" refers to the act of creating a new system, application, or component entirely from the beginning, rather than building upon or modifying an existing one. This can be a time-consuming and costly process, but in some cases, it may be necessary if the existing system or architecture is deemed unsuitable or too difficult to refactor or revamp.\"\n",

              " '1': \"Keywords and their explanations:\\n\\n1. Architectural design: the process of defining the overall structure, composition, behavior, and functionality of a software system. It involves identifying the key components, interfaces, and relationships between different parts of the system, as well as specifying the constraints, requirements, and quality attributes that the architecture must satisfy. \\n\\n2. Structural components: the primary building blocks or modules of a software system, such as classes, objects, functions, or services. These components may interact with each other through well-defined interfaces, protocols, or APIs, and may be organized hierarchically or functionally based on their roles and responsibilities. \\n\\n3. Architectural model: a high-level abstraction or representation of the software system's architecture, typically expressed using diagrams, models, or formal languages. The model may capture the system's static or dynamic aspects, and may be used to communicate the architecture to stakeholders, developers, or other interested parties. \\n\\n4. System performance: the measure of how well a software system meets its functional and non-functional requirements, such as speed, throughput, latency, scalability, and reliability. The architecture of a system can have a significant impact on its performance, as it affects the distribution of workload, the allocation of resources, and the optimization of algorithms and data structures. \\n\\n5. Efficiency: the measure of how well a software system utilizes its resources, such as CPU, memory, disk, or network bandwidth, to perform its tasks. A well-designed architecture can improve the efficiency of a system by minimizing redundancy, maximizing reuse, and optimizing the use of shared resources. \\n\\n6. Security: the measure of how well a software system protects its data, assets, and users from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. The architecture of a system can affect its security by defining the trust boundaries, access controls, encryption, and authentication mechanisms used to enforce security policies. \\n\\n7. Maintainability: the measure of how easy or difficult it is to modify, update, or extend a software system over time. The architecture of a system can influence its maintainability by promoting modularity, encapsulation, separation of concerns, and other principles of good design. \\n\\n8. Architectural design flaws: errors, omissions, or inconsistencies in the architectural design of a software system that may cause it to fail to meet its requirements, perform poorly, or be difficult to maintain. Flaws may result from inadequate analysis, poor communication, lack of expertise, or other factors, and may require costly and time-consuming rework to fix.\"}"
